## Description

Our project aims to create a user-friendly and efficient system for monitoring and managing greenhouse environments. It provides real-time data on temperature, humidity, light levels, soil moisture, and other relevant parameters. Users can remotely monitor these parameters.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of greenhouse parameters.
- Historical data analysis and visualization.
- Automatic control of environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity).
- Alerts and notifications for abnormal conditions.
- User-friendly interface accessible from anywhere.

## Technologies Used

- ArduinoMega for sensor data collection and data processing.
- GSM SIM800L for communication.
- ThingSpeak for data storage and visualization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JosephMutyaba/Green_House_Monitoring_And-_Management_System.git
